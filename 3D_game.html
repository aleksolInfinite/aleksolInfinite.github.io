                The project was initiated in 2020 by the frontman of Finnish rock band Waltari to promote Finnish culture and history.
                A group of students and professionals from different fields was quickly built. In the spring of
                2021 this group approached Metropolia in search of game programmers, which is where I joined in. We formed
                a group of game developer students to work on the project's first proof of concept using Unity, which was
                what we knew the best at the time. We spent approximately 5 months working on the proof of concept, which
                was then used to make the first privately shared marketing materials. After that was completed, we made the
                decision to experiment with Unreal Engine to make the next prototype. We worked on this next prototype for 3
                months and found Unreal Engine to be better suited for our needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the start of our Unity phase I have acted as a lead programmer, writing code in both C# in Unity and
                C++ in Unreal Engine. Other than programming, my main responsibility has been characters and gameplay mechanics.
                This includes AI, abilities, player movement, animation logic, different stats for characters etc.

            <p>
                Our prototype in UE4 was to be a single, simple dungeon, where we could do combat testing. Obviously we
                were all new to Unreal and relatively new to game development, so we didn't expect to get it perfect first try.
                And we didn't, but we reached the aim of having a baseline build which we could test and learn what to do better.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the prototype's 3D models we had help from three Metropolia students. They made our characters and weapons,
                as well as some 2D-art.
                The environment was made by our environment artist using the Megascans assets. Visual effects
                were made by another member of the group. I was responsible for programming and all gameplay mechanics.

                <h3>Abilities</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The prototype includes a comprehensive ability system, with 8 different player abilities that combine together
                to strengthen and weaken each other. These abilities were accompanied by basic melee and ranged combos.
                All combat used resources from three gauges: Health, Spirit and Ultimate. Health was obviously needed to stay
                alive, but could be drained to use Spirit abilities more effectively. Spirit gauge was our version of a
                traditional "Mana" gauge. If the player drained it too far, it started draining health also. Ultimate gauge
                was used for an ultimate attack, but could also be used for healing the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the beginning of the process, my aim was to program the abilities in a way, that would make it easy to
                create new abilities in the editor. This I feel I succeeded in, and our planned abilities could be
                created in just a few minutes per ability, and all of their stats modified during testing.
            </p>

                <h3>Stances</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                To accompany our complex abilities, we designed two stances. The default stance is the damage dealing
                stance, where your abilities are the most effective, but quickly drain your spirit gauge. To recover spirit
                gauge, the player needed to switch to spirit stance, where abilities weren't as hard hitting, but rather defensive.
                In this stance spirit gauge replenishes automatically, but also parries and well timed dodges can be used to
                speed up the gauge gains.
            </p>

                <h3>My Experience</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Working with Unreal Engine taught me new ways of programming and I'm excited to learn more. Moving forward,
                I will strive to be more organised and keep code separated in modules to make editing safer. This is something
                I've already clearly improved in since the early Unity days, but there's a long way to go still.

                This proof of concept was simply put together to be able to make a video showcasing our intentions. This
                Unity version was made before the Unreal one, but by the same people, with me in the same role of programming
                and gameplay mechanics. We lacked any 3D-artists for this project though, so all 3D-art is from free asset packs.

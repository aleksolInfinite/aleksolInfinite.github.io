            Welcome to my portfolio and <a href="resume.html">resume</a>! This is where I showcase my skills and aspirations.
            My focus is not on web development and it shows in this website, but it does the job.

                About Me
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            I am a third year ICT student at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences located in Espoo, Finland.
            My major is game development, mainly focused on programming. I have had a passion for programming and
            gaming for years now, but I took a few years to think what I really wanted and spent that time chauffeuring.
            Finally I came to the conclusion that I should start studies in the field of programming. I had my expectations
            that game programming would be my calling, but went into my studies open minded. My mind hasn't changed, programming
            and designing games is absolutely what motivates me.
        </p>
        <p>
            My completed projects are mostly small school projects, but most importantly, for the past 10 months I have
            acted as a lead programmer in a voluntary group of 5-10 people working on a 3D adventure RPG. We started with Unity, but moved to Unreal Engine 4 last autumn and currently
            making the transition to UE5. On this website I showcase what I can of the 3D RPG as well as best bits of my school projects.

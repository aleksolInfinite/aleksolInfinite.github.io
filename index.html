            Welcome to my portfolio and <a href="resume.html">resume</a>! This is where I showcase my skills and especially motivation.
            I started my studies in programming in August 2019, and HTML specifically only in January, 2020.
            The website will evolve as my skills develop, and even if it isn't the most professional website found on the web (yet),
            it delivers my great motivation to learn and to do.

            </h3>

        <p>
            I am a first year student in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences located in Espoo, Finland. I study
            ICT and will start my game programming major studies in autumn 2020. I have had a passion for programming and
            gaming for years now, but I took a few years to think what I really wanted and spent that time chauffeuring.
            Finally I came to the conclusion that I should start studies in the field of programming. I had my expectations
            that game programming would be my calling, but went into my studies open minded. My mind hasn't changed, programming
            and designing games is absolutely what motivates me.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far I have only completed projects for school, all of which are showcased on this website. As soon as I have time,
            I will begin working on hobby game projects because I crave to learn more. Best case scenario is that I land
            a trainee spot in a game development studio this first summer, so I get to experience the industry first hand
            as soon as possible, and get started on my career.

                <h2>Unity Game Project</h2></header>
            <p>
                This project was a school assignment, made over a period of three weeks in a group of three. It was my first time programming a game, writing C# and working with Unity.
                It is based on a tutorial project from Unity's "Learn"-platform, but 80% of the code is originally written by myself,
                while most of the rest I heavily modified from the original project. All of the sprites are either from the
                original tutorial and provided readily by Unity, or modified by our team from free sprite packages online.

            <p>
                Scavenger is a 2D roguelike-style dungeon survival. On every level the player must find a supply drop
                after which the exit opens. The game has a health mechanic in the form of "food" that is consumed over time,
                when completing actions (walking, attacking, etc.), and especially if sustaining damage from enemies or bombs.
                Food can be replenished by picking up food items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every level is randomly generated, with increasing difficulty and complexity.
                The first levels start of simple: player has nothing else to do but to navigate around very few enemies
                while collecting food as efficiently as possible. As the player progresses in levels, game offers new challenges
                by introducing more and new types of enemies and progressively powerful weapons to fend off the enemies.
                Map size also starts increasing exponentially. Bigger, more complex levels offer possibilities along with
                difficulties, since a skilled player may find that with more surface area comes more loot.

            <header><h3>The Project</h3></header>
            <p>
                As per course instructions, the project started by completing a freely chosen tutorial in Unity's learning
                environment. We chose the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-roguelike-tutorial" target="_blank">2D Roguelike</a>
                project, because the tutorial had an emphasis on programming and started with a blank slate. Each line of
                code was written following instructions, meaning after the tutorial was completed, all of the code felt
                like my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aim of the project was to take that completed tutorial project, and build on top of it by adding or changing
                the mechanics. Our initial thought was to add longevity, complexity, and a faster pace. The game
                born from the tutorial was slow and simple with very little escalation from early levels to later ones. Below is
                a table of the most notable mechanics we added or changed:

                Here is a <a id="game_github" href="https://github.com/aleksolInfinite/Scavenger/releases/latest" target="_blank">link to scripts on GitHub</a>.
                By estimate 10% of the code was written by following the original tutorial. The rest of it is written from scratch by myself
                or heavily edited from the original.

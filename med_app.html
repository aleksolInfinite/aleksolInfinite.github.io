            <p>
                A school project completed over two weeks in a group of three. Aim of the project was to create an Android
                app with a health aspect to it. Tools to be used were Android Studio and Java as programming language.
                Our group decided to build a medication reminder app for professional use.

            <p>
                MedReminder is a tech demo for an app that is intended to be used as part of home care. A health care professional
                is able to create patient profiles and add medication plans for that patient. The patient can then log in
                with their profile credentials. They only need to stay logged in with the app running in the background
                and the app will give reminders with information about the medication to take.

            <p>
                This was the first time any of us had done an application for any platform. We built the app from the ground up in two weeks.
                All in all the project went very well, but the amount of features we implemented left little time for polish.
                In the end, the project received top grades, but the application is very much an unfinished tech demo.
